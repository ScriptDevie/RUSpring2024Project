abstract = {A phase screen ribbon extrusion process is presented that allows a phase screen ribbon of any specified width to be extruded, one column at a time, producing a ribbon of any desired length, with Kolmogorov statistics (i.e., having a five-thirds power-law-dependent structure function) for all separations up to some selected upper limit---which upper limit can be as large as desired. The method is an adaptation of the method described by \[Ass\'{e}mat et al. Opt. Express 14, 988 (2006)\].},
