abstract = {A development history is presented for the last 25 years of research into the phenomenon of thermal blooming associated with high energy laser (HEL) beam atmospheric propagation. Attention is given to the problem of convection-dominated thermal blooming, which is the most important blooming-associated problem encountered by CW and repetitively pulsed HELs. Important results and scaling parameters are presented for the characterization of steady-state, convection-dominated whole-beam thermal-blooming effects in the cases of (1) a collimated beam in a homogeneous atmosphere, (2) focused-beam propagation, encompassing the effects of wind and beam slewing and finite attenuation, and (3) ground-to-space propagation, with and without phase-compensation.},
