abstract = {The present evaluation of recent progress in the analysis and computer modeling of adaptive optics hardware applicable to compensation for thermal blooming gives attention to an analytical theory of phase-compensation instability (PCI) that incorporates the actuator geometry of real deformable mirrors, as well as to novel algorithms for computer simulation of adaptive optics hardware. An analytical formalism is presented which facilitates the quantitative analysis of the effects of the adaptive-optics control system on PCI, and leads to both a universality theorem for PCI growth rates and the realization that wind exerts a greater influence on PCI growth rates than previously suspected. The analysis and algorithms are illustrated by the results of the time-dependent adaptively-compensated laser propagation code for thermal blooming, MOLLY, which has been optimized for the Cray-2 supercomputer.},
