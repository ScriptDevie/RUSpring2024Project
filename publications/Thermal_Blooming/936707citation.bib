abstract = {Objective:
A predictive theory for the correctability of thermal blooming in the presence of
turbulence that is appropriate to very high Fresnel number beams and that does not rely
solely on nonlinear wave optics code calculations.
Approach:
Exploit the facts that the physics of such beams are both local and linear. Calculate an
MCF analytically using linear theory and compare with fully nonlinear numerical result.
Infer whole beam Strehi from either.},
